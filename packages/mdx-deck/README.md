## Getting Started

Create an [MDX][] file and separate each slide with `---`.

````mdx
# This is the title of my deck

---

# About Me

---

```jsx
<CodeSnippet />
```

---

import Demo from './components/Demo'

<Demo />

---

# The end
````

Add a run script to your `package.json` with the MDX Deck CLI
pointing to the `.mdx` file to start the dev server:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "mdx-deck deck.mdx"
}
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

## Using MDX

MDX can use Markdown syntax and render React components with JSX.

### Imports

To import components, use ES import syntax separated with empty lines between any markdown or JSX syntax.

```mdx
import { Box } from 'grid-styled'

<Box color="tomato">Hello</Box>
```

Read more about MDX syntax in the [MDX Docs][mdx].

## Theming

MDX Deck uses [Theme UI][], making virtually any part of the presentation themeable.

### Built-in Themes

MDX Deck includes several built-in themes to change the look and feel of the presentation.
Export `theme` from your MDX file to enable a theme.

```mdx
export { dark as theme } from 'mdx-deck/themes'

# Dark Theme
```

For a list of available themes see the [Themes Docs](docs/themes.md).

### Custom Themes

A custom theme can be provided by exporting `theme` from the MDX file.

```mdx
import myTheme from './theme'

export const theme = myTheme

# Hello
```

Read more about customizing in the [Theming Docs](docs/theming.md).

## Components

MDX Deck includes built-in components to help with creating presentations,
including a full screen Image component,
the Appear component that allows stepping through parts of a single slide,
and the Notes component for adding speaker notes.

Read more in the [components docs](docs/components.md).

## Layouts

Each slide can include a custom layout around its content.
This can be used as a substitute for slide templates found in other presentation apps and libraries.

```js
// example Layout.js
import React from 'react'

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      width: '100vw',
      height: '100vw',
      backgroundColor: 'tomato',
    }}>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

```mdx
import Layout from './Layout'

# No Layout

---

<Layout>

# Custom Layout

</Layout>
```

The layout component will wrap the MDX elements within that slide,
which means you can use a nested ThemeProvider or target elements with CSS-in-JS.

### Built-in Layouts

MDX Deck includes some built-in layouts for inverting theme colors and changing the layout of a slide.
Read more about [built-in layouts](docs/components.md#layouts).

## Presenter Mode

MDX Deck includes a built-in _Presenter Mode_, with a preview of the next slide and a timer.

![presenter mode screenshot](docs/images/presenter-mode.png)

### Speaker Notes

Notes that only show in presenter mode can be added to any slide.
Speaker notes can be added using the `<Notes />` component.

```mdx
import { Notes } from 'mdx-deck'

# Slide Content

<Notes>Only visible in presenter mode</Notes>
```

## Gatsby

MDX Deck is built with [Gatsby][] and is also available as a Gatsby theme,
which means you can customize any part of the interface with shadowing,
use the entire ecosystem of Gatsby plugins,
incorporate presentations into other Gatsby sites,
and even extend MDX Deck to create your own custom version.
